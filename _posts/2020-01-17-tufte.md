In December, I attended [Edward Tufte's course on Presenting Data and Information](https://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/courses).
Here are my key takeaways from the course.

# The purpose of data is to make people smarter &rarr; don't dumb it down
When presenting information, chances are the audience has already been filtered by some homogenizing process&mdash;your colleagues, people that have made a conscious decision to come to your presentation, etc.

### National Weather Service
An example of an appropriate amount of data is the National Weather Service.

Most visitors to the National Weather Service website care about the temperature and conditions (eg. mostly cloudy). This information is accurately and concisely presented via a large "59&deg;F" and image representing mostly cloudy conditions.

However, more data points are available to constituents that require more information&mdash;as a pilot, the wind speed, barometric pressure, dewpoint, and visibility are some factors that determine if I'm flying or staying on the ground (these measurements are probably from the [SFO Terminal Area Forecast](https://aviationweather.gov/taf/board?ids=KSFO&format=expanded)).

- doctor shortage (bad)

# Minimize design-figuring-out time, maximize content reasoning time

- legends/direct labeling (scatterplot/pie chart)
- each data scenario is unique and best-served by a unique solution (Minard)
    - Sankey diagram
    - Tufte art map
    - mall directory

# It's better to be approximately right than precisely wrong
I'll let the following excerpt from Tufte's <i>Beautiful Evidence</i> do the talking on this one.

And finally, here's a great example of what not to do:
