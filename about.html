<p>
I'm a full-stack software engineer looking for opportunities to develop products serving a social good.
I started making websites in high school, and have since progressed through frontend development, backend development, and infrastructure.
Having a background in computer science and music, I enjoy playing in the intersection of the two. Recent projects include <a href="https://www.envelop.us/">Envelop</a>, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API">Web Audio API</a>, and <a href="https://sunhou.se/">Sunhouse</a>.
I'm currently in the process of getting my private pilot license, and I am continually awestruck by California's beauty.
