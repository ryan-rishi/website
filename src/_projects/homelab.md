# Homelab

An ongoing project for services I run at home. Services include ddclient, Wireguard, PiHole, a Synology NAS with some NFS shares, and Grafana/Telegraf/InfluxDB to monitor it all. Everything is provisioned via Ansible.

As of June 2020, I'm currently in the processing of migrating services from a handful Raspberry Pis to an Intel NUC, with everything in Docker containers.

Source (Ansible playbook) available at [Github](https://github.com/ryanrishi/devops).
