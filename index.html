<p>
  I'm a full-stack software engineer looking for opportunities to develop products serving a social good.
  I started making websites in high school, and have since progressed through frontend development, backend development, and infrastructure.
  Having a background in computer science and music, I enjoy playing in the intersection of the two.
  I'm currently in the process of getting my private pilot license, and I am continually awestruck by California's beauty.
