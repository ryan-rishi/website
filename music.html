<h3>Senior Recital</h3>
<p>As a music major, I was awarded the opportunity to put on a recital in my senior year. It composed of various musical elements including live looping marimba with <a href="https://www.ableton.com/">Ableton Live</a>, percussion ensemble, <em>a cappella</em>, gamelan, and mallet solos.</p>

<h3>Percussion Covers</h3>
<p>In college, I enjoyed arranging and recording popular songs played on keyboard percussion instruments.</p>

<h3>Recording</h3>
<p>
  I've produced two albums.
  The first is Christmas In Claradise, which was a joint effort with the five <em>a cappella</em> groups at Santa Clara University. You can read about it <a href="{% post_url 2015-12-27-the-twelve-days-of-an-a-cappella-christmas-album %}">here</a>.

    The second is <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/5Tbpm70sMQ2aUwdsEieHn5?si=pucr00KFSq-X_hMGfvNRrA">Bellomy</a>, an album of songs written by my band from college.
