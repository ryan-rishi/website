# Hi, I'm Ryan 👋🏼

<div className="flex flex-col md:flex-row">
<div className="md:w-1/2 lg:w-2/3 flex-grow flex-shrink md:mr-4">

  I'm a twenty-something year old software engineer in California.

  I recently joined [Envoy](https://envoy.com/), a startup in San Francisco, where I'm building out its external developer platform. Previously, I worked at [Jelli](https://www.jelli.com/), an audio ad tech startup that was acquired by [iHeartMedia](https://www.iheartmedia.com/), and before that I was at [Skybox Imaging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SkySat), a satellite imaging company which was acquired by Google in 2014.

  I have experience in backend development, frontend development, and infrastructure. My specialities include Java, Spring/Spring Boot, identity and authorization protocols, and distributed systems.

  Outside of work, I have developed even more software such as a bot to text me when a campsite I'm interested in is available, a homelab for me to play around with infrastructure, and contribute to some of my favorite open-source projects.

  Okayokay&mdash; I do other things besides software too! I was a music major in college and still love to play drums and piano. I'm also in the process of getting my private pilot license (there's nothing quite like flying over California at ~3000 feet). I enjoy cooking, and have been called _ the pasta prince_ and _the spaghetti king 🍝👑_.
