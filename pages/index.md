# Hi, I'm Ryan 👋🏼

I'm a twenty-something year old software engineer in California.

I recently joined a startup in San Francisco where I'm building out its external developer platform. Previously, I've worked at [Jelli](https://www.jelli.com/), and audio ad tech startup that was acquired by [iHeartMedia](https://www.iheartmedia.com/), and before that, I was at [Skybox Imaging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SkySat), which was acquired by Google in 2014.

I have experience in backend development, frontend development, and infrastructure. My specialities are Java, Spring/Spring Boot, identity and authorization protocols, and distributed systems.

Outside of work, I have developed even more software such as a bot to text me when a campsite I'm interested in is available, a homelab for me to play around with infrastructure, and contribute to some of my favorite open-source projects.

Okayokay&mdash;I do other things besides software too! I was a music major in college and still play drums and piano. I'm also in the process of getting my private pilot license (there's nothing quite like flying over California at ~3000 feet). I also enjoy cooking, and have been called _ the pasta prince_ and _spaghetti king 👑_.
